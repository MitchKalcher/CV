<!-- There is also other meta attributes such as description. This is what you will see under the name of the website when searching on google. There is also many others. these can be looked up on W3schools or MDN Webdocs (bookmarked) -->

<!-- How to indent and structure a HTML file -->

<!-- The best practise is to wirte and indent it hierachilly. This can be bee seen with the head and title tags. the title tag is indented as it is inside the head tag. body however is indented the samew as the head tag. this is to show that they arent indented at the same level. if you were to have a tag inside of h1 for example, you would want to indent it again -->
